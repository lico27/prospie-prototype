3.2	The Basis of Faith as at the date of these Articles is: 

BASIS OF FAITH

We believe: 
1.	That Jesus is the Christ, real, fully human, and fully God. We believe that Jesus came to show us what God is like and what a God honouring life looks like. We accept many people use God-substitutes to give their lives meaning instead of God. We believe that the risen Christ is the only way to God, that people need to turn to God and have their lives restored, and that this is made possible through Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. We believe God reconciles the whole of creation to himself through Jesus. 

2.	In the one God who communes in three persons – the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and that all are jointly active in creation, salvation, and in empowering us today.

3.	God created us to be His image bearers and have a relationship with Him. We believe that this relationship has been broken, and cannot be earned, nor is it our right, but rather the gift of God through all who place their hope and trust in Jesus. We believe this is good news, and we are called to help others love Jesus more. We believe that Jesus intercedes for all people today. 

4.	The Holy Spirit is at work in renewal, enabling us to encounter Jesus personally in each believer as they seek to worship and witness in their everyday lives.

5.	The Bible is God’s inspired word, in which we find life, hope and wisdom.

6.	That being a Christian isn’t a thing we do just on Sundays, that Church isn’t something that just happens in a building, and that God’s grace abounds everywhere – sometimes where we least expect it. We believe that Jesus Christ is coming again. We believe Christians need to join in with the mission that Jesus started and bring good news to all people and creation. We believe that Church is part of God’s design, and that discipleship best happens in community.

7.	That resurrection is real, and part of the promise for those that trust Jesus. We believe that heaven and earth will be brought together one day, renewing all things. We believe if people don’t want God (choosing not to receive Jesus), they can choose eternity without Him."
